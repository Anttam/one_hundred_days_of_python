# Day 23
The project for today is my take on the classic game frogger. The player has to try and get their turtle across a very busy highway. The player can use the W and S keys to move the turtle forward and backward trying to dodge the cars. The cars move from right to left and once the car gets to the end of the screen, it is replaced by another car in a random starting point. If the player makes it to the end of the level, all the cars are cleared, the speed of them is increased, and the player is sent back to the beginning starting the loop over again. If the player ends up getting hit by one of the cars, they are shown a game over screen.
