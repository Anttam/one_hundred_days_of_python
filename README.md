# 100 Days of Python

I am following along with a 100 days of python challange that I found on Udemy. The first few days should be relatively easy because this course is intended for beginners and increasing in complexity as the challenge continues.

## Goal

The reason that I have decided to take on this challenge is to improve upon my python skills and try more challenging scripting projects. As a side challenge, I am also planning on uploading each day to GitHub so that I have a way to track my progress.

## Structure

The way that this course is structured is to have a project for each of the 100 days. I am planning on completeing each project starting with day 1 and working up to day 100.

## Methods

I am planning on accomplishing each of these projects in under 2 hours every weekday as my weekends are typically very busy.
