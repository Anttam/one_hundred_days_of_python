# Day 29
The project for today is a password manager GUI. The user has a pre populated email and can put in the name of the website and the password they would like to save for that website. The user can also click the generate button to generate a new password. if the user does not fill in one of the fields, they are given a pop up warning that they need to enter information into each field. If the fields are filled in, the user is given a confirmation pop up. If they click Ok, the fields are cleared from the manager and the password is written to a .txt file within the project that saves the information.
