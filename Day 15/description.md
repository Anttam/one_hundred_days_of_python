# Day 15 
The project for today is an automated coffee machine. The user selects from 3 different coffee choices. The machine checks if it has the milk, water, and coffee to make the selected drink. If there is not enough of any of the particular ingredient, the machine will notify the user which ingredients it does not have enough of. The price of the drink is then printed and the user is prompted to enter the amount of quarters, dimes, nickles, and pennies they are paying with. The machine then checks if the amount is enough and makes the drink, subtracting the required amount of each resource from the reserve. If the user paid more than the cost of the coffee, it then gets gives them change. A report can be ran to check the levels of the reserves and to see how much money is in the machine.
